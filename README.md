# 🫀 LifeBridge — Real-Time Organ Tracking & Allocation Platform

**A Secure, Intelligent, and Compliant System for Organ Allocation and Transport Logistics**

> *Developed to bridge lives through precision, security, and innovation.*

---

## 🚀 Overview

**LifeBridge** is an enterprise-grade, end-to-end platform for real-time organ tracking, allocation, and transport coordination between donor hospitals, transplant centers, and logistics teams.

The system leverages **strong encryption**, **real-time telemetry**, and **compliance-grade auditing** to ensure that every organ reaches the right patient — safely, quickly, and transparently.

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

### 📦 Real-Time Organ Lifecycle Management
- End-to-end visibility from donor to recipient  
- Automated organ matching using HLA and compatibility scoring  
- Live tracking of transport status and environmental conditions  
- Intelligent viability alerts and allocation prioritization  

### 🔐 Medical-Grade Data Security
- AES-256-GCM encryption for all Protected Health Information (PHI)  
- Role-based access control for hospitals, surgeons, and coordinators  
- Full compliance with HIPAA, GDPR, and ISO/IEC 27001 standards  
- Immutable audit trails and session-level event logging  

### 🚚 Smart Logistics & Telemetry
- GPS-tracked organ transport with real-time synchronization  
- Environmental data capture (temperature, weather, route deviation)  
- Support for ground, drone, and airlift transportation modes  
- Automated notifications and exception handling  

### 🛡️ Compliance & Accountability
- Field-level encryption with authenticated data access  
- Multi-layer audit logging for every system event  
- Chain-of-custody verification through digital signatures  
- PHI access flags for compliance auditing
