# ü´Ä LifeBridge ‚Äî Real-Time Organ Tracking & Allocation Platform

**A Secure, Intelligent, and Compliant System for Organ Allocation and Transport Logistics**

> *Developed to bridge lives through precision, security, and innovation.*

---

## üöÄ Overview

**LifeBridge** is an enterprise-grade, end-to-end platform for real-time organ tracking, allocation, and transport coordination between donor hospitals, transplant centers, and logistics teams.

The system leverages **strong encryption**, **real-time telemetry**, and **compliance-grade auditing** to ensure that every organ reaches the right patient ‚Äî safely, quickly, and transparently.

- Role-based access control for hospitals, surgeons, and coordinators
- Full compliance with HIPAA, GDPR, and ISO/IEC 27001
- Immutable audit trails and session-level event logging

### üöö Smart Logistics & Telemetry
- GPS-tracked organ transport with real-time updates
- Environmental condition monitoring (temperature, weather, route deviation)
- Support for ground, drone, and airlift transportation modes
- Automated exception handling and notifications

### üõ°Ô∏è Compliance & Accountability
- Field-level encryption and authenticated data access
- Multi-layer audit logging for every system event
- Chain-of-custody verification via digital signatures
- PHI access flagging for compliance audits
